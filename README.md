# Analyzing-Car-Values

This is a project done for my Advanced Statistics in Data Science course (OPRE 6304).
Please find my final report, R code, and cleaned raw data in an Excel file

## Executive Summary

In this paper, we look at the composition of a car’s value. We evaluate the most valuable features of a car including the engine’s characteristics, car’s dimensions and features, safety features, and additional features that help with the driving experience. We use stepwise selection to find the most relevant variables and then create a model using a regression in order to predict what a car’s true value is. Using this value, we find over-valued and under-valued cars based on the predictions of the model. 
The most significant factors which accounted for most of the difference in a car’s value was its engine type, suspension type and net horsepower. The transmission type, drivetrain, passenger capacity, fuel type, fuel economy and steering type did also affect the retail price, but to a lesser extent than the first variables. Additional features such as child safety locks, parking aid and back-up cameras were also statistically significant.
